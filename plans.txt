--The goal:
 to create a script that manages your to-do list. It should be able to print a list of them to the terminal, to add new items to the list, and to mark items as completed.

-- Make a class called Item. Objects of this class should have the following attributes:
   1) A timestamp of when they were created.
   2) A boolean marking the item as completed or not.
   3) the text of the actual to-do item.


--Make a class called Manager. A single object of this class should be created when you run your script. It should do the following:
   1) Print all of the to-do items in the list.
   2) Add a new item to the list.
   3)Mark an item as completed.

--Each class should be in its own module which you will need to import accordingly.

-- The main file should be called todos.py and is the only file to be run as a script.

-- Your to-do list should be stored in a file called todos.txt. You should never need to edit this file directly, the script should do that for you.

DATETIME- The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways.

--How will you retrieve the data from the file?
--How will it be organized so you can break the data into separate values?
--How can you convert that data into different Python types
--How will your script work?
--Will it expect arguments to be passed to it?
--Will it run like an interactive program like our games?
